    Start: The starting rule that represents the top-level of your grammar. It calculates an expression and prints the result.

    Expression: Represents an arithmetic expression, which can be a sequence of terms separated by addition or subtraction operators.
     It calculates the result by performing addition or subtraction on terms.

    Term: Represents a term in an expression, which can be a sequence of factors separated by multiplication or division operators.
     It calculates the result by performing multiplication or division on factors.

    Factor: Represents the most basic elements in the grammar. 
    A factor can be a number or an expression enclosed within parentheses.

The grammar's production rules are as follows:

    Start -> Expression
    Expression -> Term ((PLUS | MINUS) Term)*
    Term -> Factor ((MULTIPLY | DIVIDE) Factor)*
    Factor -> NUMBER | LPAREN Expression RPAREN

These rules define the structure of arithmetic expressions and how different components of the expressions are combined and evaluated.
 When you input an arithmetic expression, the parser will use these rules to parse and evaluate the expression accordingly.
